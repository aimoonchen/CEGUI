Font files can define one of two types of font\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A Free\+Type font, which is based upon standard font files -\/ such as .ttf files -\/ where glyphs get dynamically rendered to an internal cache as needed.
\item A Pixmap font, which is based on an Imageset that contains the predrawn bitmap representations of the character glyphs the font will render.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The reference for each element is arranged into sections, as described below\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Purpose\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This section describes what the elements general purpose is within the specifications.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Attributes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This section describes available attributes for the elements, and whether they are required or optional.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Usage\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Describes where the element may appear, whether the element may have sub-\/elements, and other important usage information.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Examples\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For many elements, this section will contain brief examples showing the element used in context.

 \hypertarget{xml_font_xml_font_font}{}\section{$<$\+Font$>$ Element}\label{xml_font_xml_font_font}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Purpose\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The $<$Font$>$ element is the root element in X\+ML font definition files.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Attributes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily version\+:} specifies the version of the resource file. Should be specified for all files, current C\+E\+G\+UI font version is\+: 3
\item {\ttfamily type\+:} Specifies the type of font being defined. This should be one of the following values\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Free\+Type\+:} Indicates a font based upon a standard font file (such as a true-\/type \textquotesingle{}.ttf\textquotesingle{} font).
\item {\ttfamily Pixmap\+:} Indicates a font based upon an Imageset which defines Images for the font glyphs.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily name\+:} Specifies the name that will be used to identify the Font within the C\+E\+G\+UI system. Required attribute.
\item {\ttfamily filename\+:} Specifies the path to the associated resource for the font. Required attribute.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For Free\+Type type fonts this should reference a standard font file loadable by the freetype2 library (such as a .ttf file, or similar).
\item For Pixmap type fonts this should reference an an Imageset.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily resource\+Group\+:} Specifies the resource group identifier to pass to the Resource\+Provider when loading the file given in the {\ttfamily Filename} attribute. For Pixmap type fonts, this may be the special value {\ttfamily \char`\"{}$\ast$\char`\"{}} to indicate the Imagseset specified in {\ttfamily Filename} is actually the name of an already loaded Imagesest rather than the name of an Imageset X\+Ml file to be loaded. Optional attribute.
\item {\ttfamily size\+:} Specifies the point size for a Free\+Type type font. This is ignored for Pixmap type fonts. Optional attribute, default is 12.
\item {\ttfamily anti\+Alias\+:} Boolean attribute that states whether the font should be rendered anti-\/aliased. This setting only affects Free\+Type type fonts. Optional attribute, default is true.
\item {\ttfamily auto\+Scaled\+:} Property that specifies how to scale glyphs in relation to the specified native resolution. The native resolution values are intended to indicate the resolution that would result in a one-\/to-\/one (i.\+e. unscaled) mapping from source to destination. At display resolutions higher than the native, the glyphs will be scaled {\itshape up} to take up more space, and at display resolutions lower than the native, glyphs will be scaled {\itshape down} to take up less space. Possible values for this attribute are as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item vertical -\/ glyphs are auto scaled depending on the native resolution height and the current resolution height. Horizontal scaling is computed appropriately to maintain aspect ratio.
\item horizontal -\/ glyphs are auto scaled depending on the native resolution width and the current resolution width. Vertical scaling is computed appropriately to maintain aspect ratio.
\item min -\/ Vertical and horizontal scaling factors are calculated as above and glyphs are auto scaled according to the smaller of the two scaling factors. Aspect ratio is maintained.
\item max -\/ Vertical and horizontal scaling factors are calculated as above and glyphs are auto scaled according to the larger of the two scaling factors. Aspect ratio is maintained.
\item true -\/ Vertical and horizontal scaling factors are calculated as above and glyph height and width are scaled independently. Aspect ratio is {\itshape not} maintained.
\item false -\/ no auto scaling of glyphs will be performed. Optional attribute, default is false.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily native\+Horz\+Res\+:} When Auto\+Scaled is enabled, specifies the horizontal screen resolution that will result in an unscaled, one-\/to-\/one mapping of pixels from the source image to the destination surface. Optional attribute, default is 640.
\item {\ttfamily native\+Vert\+Res\+:} When Auto\+Scaled is enabled, specifies the vertical screen resolution that will result in an unscaled, one-\/to-\/one mapping of pixels from the source image to the destination surface. Optional attribute, default is 480.
\item {\ttfamily line\+Spacing\+:} Specifies a line spacing value to be used in preference to what is extracted from the underlying font file (useful if the font file is made with a bad line spacing value). If set to zero, the value from the underlying font file is used instead. This setting only affects Free\+Type type fonts. Optional attribute, default is 0.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Usage\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The $<$Font$>$ element is the root element for font files.
\item The $<$Font$>$ element may contain any number of $<$Mapping$>$ elements.
\item No element may contain a $<$Font$>$ element as a sub-\/element.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Examples\+:

 \hypertarget{xml_font_xml_font_mapping}{}\section{$<$\+Mapping$>$ Element}\label{xml_font_xml_font_mapping}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Purpose\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The $<$Mapping$>$ element is used only with Pixmap type fonts and defines a mapping between a U\+T\+F32 codepoint value and an Image defined on the associated Imageset. A Mapping must be supplied for each codepoint that the font is to have available for rendering.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Attributes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily codepoint\+:} Specifies the Unicode codepoint to produce a mapping for. Required attribute.
\item {\ttfamily image\+:} Specifies the name of the image to map to the codepoint specified in {\ttfamily Codepoint}. This named image must be defined for the Imageset identified in the {\ttfamily Filename} attribute of the containing $<$Font$>$ element.
\item {\ttfamily horz\+Advance\+:} Specifies a number of pixels to advance the \textquotesingle{}pen\textquotesingle{} position after rendering the image specified in this mapping. A value of -\/1 will cause an appropriate value to be auto-\/calculated. Optional attribute, default is -\/1.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Usage\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The $<$Mapping$>$ element may only appear as a sub-\/element of the $<$Font$>$ element.
\item The $<$Mapping$>$ element may not contain any sub-\/elements.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Examples\+:
