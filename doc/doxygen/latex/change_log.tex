\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bug Fix\+: make dist missed premake.\+lua for Inventory\+Demo
\item Bug Fix\+: Imagery\+Section bounds calculations were incorrectly starting from zero.
\item Bug Fix\+: Show Combobox button in pushed state when list is shown.
\item Bug Fix\+: Set disabled image for combobox button. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=633}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=633}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Support Gentoo\textquotesingle{}s (and others\textquotesingle{}) modified zlib headers. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=813}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=813}}
\item Bug Fix\+: typos in macro to detect zlib prevented using zlib in custom locations.
\item Bug Fix\+: Multiple issues in Group\+Box related to handling of its content pane and also how child content is added and removed. NB\+: This does change some behaviour, in that child content is no longer destroyed when removed, but that should N\+E\+V\+ER have happened anyway, so is treated as another bug to be fixed. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=6126}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=2\&t=6126}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Backported fix for issue caused by layout\+On\+Write property definitions triggering Window\+::perform\+Child\+Window\+Layout before the window is fully initialised. (NB\+: this breaks binary compatibility) See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=29008\#p29008}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?p=29008\#p29008}} and \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=645}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=645}}
\item Bug Fix\+: C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Ogre\+Texture\+Target\+::clear sets the Ogre system view port. This call can occur outside the regular rendering sequence and if the Ogre\+Texture\+Target is then deleted, Ogre and other parts of the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Ogre\+Renderer may try to access the deleted viewport. I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+NT\+: Prior to Ogre 1.\+8, there are scenarios where it is impossible to restore the view port safely.

\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure properties defined via Property\+Definition are added to the target widget first, to avoid situations where they might be accessed before they are added. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6019}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=6019}}

\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Release 0.\+7.\+3}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure return value from inject\+Mouse\+Button\+Down is consistent in all cases. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=397}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=397}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure Irrlicht\+Resource\+Provider correctly detects when a file does not open successfully (as opposed to just checking that it exists). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=395}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=395}}
\item Bug Fix\+: resolve infinite recursion issue involving Tooltip\+::position\+Self. Solution is not all that elegant, but it does work and does not break other things which could happen by \textquotesingle{}tuning\textquotesingle{} where we call position\+Self. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=394}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=394}}

\item Bug Fix\+: Do not have String\+::iterator subclass String\+::const\+\_\+iterator, since it prevents common iterator behaviours (because it was never possible to receive an object that behaved like a non-\/const iterator). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=384}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=384}}.

\item Bug Fix\+: Ogre\+Texture\+::save\+To\+Memory did not work all the time.
\item Bug Fix\+: We no longer need to save linker aggro because we don\textquotesingle{}t link directly to C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Xerces\+Parser any more, so instead it\textquotesingle{}s better not to link everything to xerces-\/c \+:-\/p
\item Bug Fix\+: Help and status strings in configure that relate to the Image\+Codec modules.
\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure main libs var is not contaminated with image libs, otherwise we end up linking everything to freeimage or some such thing.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve issues with build flag setup / contamination which lead to all modules being linked against the GL and X11 libs.

\item Bug Fix\+: Interaction between scrollabrs and formatting for the multi-\/line editbox was incorrect causing scrollbars to incorrectly display under certain conditions. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=355}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=355}}

\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure we initialise the Rect objects that cache the various areas. Issue flagged up via valgrind, see\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4710}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4710}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Ogre samples would die upon exit (at least in full-\/screen mode). This was caused by trying to notify about display size changes after the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+System is destroyed. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=22091\#p22091}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?p=22091\#p22091}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Scale mouse wheel correctly for O\+IS under the Ogre sample base app.
\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure size used for rendering window is using the same pixel aligned rounding as other parts of the system. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4701}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=3\&t=4701}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Add testing for {\bfseries{Net\+B\+SD}} so we compile correctly on that OS variant also. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=338}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=338}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resizing host application window could leave dangling pointers to A\+PI level textures in cached geometry for Rendering\+Windows, causing access violation errors. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=337}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=337}}
\item Bug Fix\+: static build / linking was not working correctly for autotools based builds.
\item Bug Fix\+: Begin unification of support for build and version suffixes for Win32 and other builds. This should basically fix module loading issues for autotools based Min\+GW builds configured with suffix / version numbers.
\item Bug Fix\+: Remove unnecessary header includes and just declare the required functions as extern \char`\"{}\+C\char`\"{} for the static builds. Static build preferences as to modules are controlled by which lib is linked, not by which header gets included -\/ they all define the same functions!
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve some issues regarding window min/max size application. Resolves\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=157}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=157}} amongst other issues.

\item Bug Fix\+: Windows uses U\+T\+F-\/16 / wchar\+\_\+t$\ast$ types for filenames rather than U\+T\+F8, meaning the Default\+Resource\+Provider would fail to load files using international characters. Via patch from \textquotesingle{}itten\textquotesingle{}\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=334}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=334}} (actual mods used a slightly sanitised version of the patch)
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve clipping issue caused because clipping regions were not always correctly pixel aligned. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=333}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=333}}. NB\+: Went for the per-\/renderer fix as opposed to a single fix in, say, C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Window, in order that we ensure regions set from elsewhere in the future do not need to remember to use the Pixel\+Aligned macro.
\item Bug Fix\+: Scrollbars for Static\+Text type widgets, if needed intially, would not show until after a redraw of the window was triggered. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=329}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=329}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue where Property\+Definition could throw if \textquotesingle{}get\textquotesingle{} was called without having previously called \textquotesingle{}set\textquotesingle{} -\/ due to the implementation user string not getting created until then. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=332}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=332}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Taharez\+Look frame window right edge was not rendering. Thanks to sfb! \+:-\/p
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve issues where a Window\textquotesingle{}s content was being clipped to it\textquotesingle{}s parent window area(s) instead of it\textquotesingle{}s own. Note the following additional issues this fix exposes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \textquotesingle{}clipped\textquotesingle{} attribute / setting for State\+Imagery in Falagard is broken and currently has no effect (this is due to clipping being done at Geometry\+Buffer level). This issue is best demonstrated by the clipping now done on dragged list header segments.
\item Some layouts / falagard compound widgets have visible clipping artefacts\+: Text\+Demo\textquotesingle{}s layout needs a couple of tweaks, and the Widget\+Looks for Tab\+Control (at least) have a couple of issues where component widgets do not join together correctly.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Bug Fix\+: Conflict between Release and Release\+With\+Symbols. The customized premake file(s) will be committed later.
\item Bug Fix\+: Frame\+Component clipping was broken in the renderer rewrite.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve bug where certain dimensions specified in looknfeel would give incorrect results.
\item Bug Fix\+: Default\+Rendered\+String\+Parser did not support line breaks (which was different to the pre 0.\+7.\+x behaviour for text).
\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure Horz\+Extent and Vert\+Extent read-\/only properties are banned from being output to X\+ML. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=325}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=325}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Backport alpha blending fixes from trunk. Decided to accept the small-\/ish interface changes (will not affect 99.\+9999\% of users) to get these highly important fixes.
\item Bug Fix\+: Update the \textquotesingle{}extra\textquotesingle{} state initialisers for the GL renderer so that alpha test is disabled.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve C++0x related compilation issue for Multi\+Column\+List on (at least) M\+S\+V\+C++ 10 betas.
\item Bug Fix\+: Support gl\+Blend\+Func\+Separate via the G\+L\+\_\+\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+blend\+\_\+func\+\_\+separate extension as well as the native GL 1.\+4 support for it.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve issues for the use of Ogre with C\+E\+G\+UI that were dependant upon which libs Ogre was built with. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=320}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=320}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Alpha blend issue for the Ogre renderer.
\item Bug Fix\+: Alpha blending for D3\+D9 and D3\+D10 renderer modules.
\item Bug Fix\+: Alpha blending issue that especially affected Open\+GL F\+BO texture targets. NB\+: Fixes for other renderers to follow soon.
\item Bug Fix\+: Use correct G\+Lint type (rather than long) in Apple\+P\+B\+Texture\+Target to resolve potential compilation issues if G\+Lint is typedef\textquotesingle{}d to an incompatible type. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4553}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=3\&t=4553}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Vanilla skin did not have the Frame\+Window close button set as non-\/client window (meaning it was appearing in the main client area. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4557}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4557}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue where String object instances were being defined from forward ref declaration only (i.\+e. Missing C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+String.\+h include). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=317}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=317}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue where certain window content would not have Geometry\+Buffer position / clipping information updated correctly depending upon order of operations. Additionally sees that parent sized notification is now only selectively called when a window\textquotesingle{}s parent is set/changed. Should fix\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4455}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=3\&t=4455}}
\item Modified\+: Change comments in config.\+lua to clarify how C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+\_\+\+E\+X\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+P\+A\+T\+HS should be used, and to give a more accurate example.
\item Modified\+: Always output exception messages to stderr.
\item Modified\+: Update embedded G\+L\+EW lib to the latest version (1.\+5.\+4), including modification to work around GL typedef differences in the OS X 10.\+4 S\+DK.
\item Modified\+: Cleanup Irrlicht event pusher + don\textquotesingle{}t force initially centred mouse position.
\item Modified\+: Replace Drive\+Icons with a version we can be sure about the copyright status of. Prior version appears to use non free imagery for some icons.
\item Modified\+: Replace try / catch / throw with macros C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+\_\+\+T\+RY / C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+\_\+\+C\+A\+T\+CH / C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+\_\+\+T\+H\+R\+OW. This was done to attempt to fill this request\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=242}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=242}}. Note that there is no added setting for this, and no \textquotesingle{}built in\textquotesingle{} mechanism that calls a user function. The use of the macros does however allow users to pre-\/define the macros to do something different. This said, tests show that the likelyhood of anybody actually being able to easily pull of a modification that allows exceptions not to be used -\/ for example, by using the mechanism suggested in the first post of the topic linked in the mantis ticket -\/ is pretty much non-\/existant. At least having this provision allows them to prove it to themselves, because, as with the OP in that topic, they don\textquotesingle{}t seem to believe you when you tell them ;)
\item Modified\+: Update some window / looknfeel config to enable mouse event propagation for some compound widgets to restore common behaviours. For\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=318}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=318}}
\item Modified\+: When frame window roll-\/up state is toggled, invalidate recursively so that child content visuals are forced to redraw.
\item Modified\+: Update to use Automake 1.\+10
\item Modified\+: Switch Xcode back to using a static set up for Irrlicht S\+DK (since they no longer appear to use a framework for mac)
\item Modified\+: Changes to allow better control over rendering processes when using the Ogre renderer.
\item Modified\+: Disable version suffix on Min\+GW / autotools build by default (because loading modules still does not work due to libtool using a \textquotesingle{}.\textquotesingle{} delimiter on $\ast$nix and \textquotesingle{}-\/\textquotesingle{} on Min\+GW).
\item Modified\+: Clean up the scroll bar cpp/h files, applying code standards and formatting.
\item Modified\+: Cleanup the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Default\+Resource\+Provider.\+cpp file and to start logging the full filename in errors as opposed to just the local resource name part.
\item Modified\+: Make interface for banning Window properties from X\+ML output public (and extend it a little, too)
\item Modified\+: Update Demo7 to use a mapped window type that automatically gets the wobbly effect set for each instance.
\item Modified\+: Update Demo7 to use the Render\+Effect\+Manager instead of creating the effects directly (though that is still supported, if someome wants to do that).
\item Modified\+: In the samples, don\textquotesingle{}t grab the mouse and keyboard in debug builds when using Ogre under X.
\item Modified\+: Make Listbox\+::get\+Item\+At\+Point function public. I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+NT\+: The Point object passed has changed from being a window local position to being a screen position!! See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=319}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=319}}
\item Added\+: save\+Window\+Layout functions to Window\+Manager to enable saving directly to a named file.
\item Added\+: explicit copy constructors for some of the basic data types; to aid in binding other languages \+:) Thanks to Kulik.
\item Added\+: Kulik\textquotesingle{}s integrated animation system. T\+O\+DO\+: add X\+ML writing code.
\item Added\+: Layout\+Container classes to automate layout of child windows. Contributed by Kulik (Martin Preisler). Fills this\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=214}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=214}}.
\item Added\+: Window\+::get\+Child\+Window\+Content\+Area (and associated virtual \+\_\+impl functions) to allow separation of areas used for clipping and those used for positioning and sizing child content. This is actually required to be able to reliably set up clipping for certain special cases -\/ such as Scrollable\+Pane -\/ which would fail previously under some scenarios.
\item Added\+: Support for useful help strings for properties defined in Falagard X\+ML.
\item Added\+: bootstrap\+System / destroy\+System functions for the D3D based renderer modules + move samples over to using that func.
\item Added\+: Functionality to enable client code to easily invalidate all cached rendering data, so that on the next redraw everything is regenerated.
\item Added\+: Mouse\+Cursor\+::invalidate function to allow client code to invalidate cached mouse cursor geometry.
\item Added\+: Setting to Listbox\+Text\+Item that allows text tag parsing to be disabled.
\item Added\+: bootstrap\+System / destroy\+System helpers on Open\+GL renderer. Preparation work to simplify / unify system creation for all official renderers (and make coming tutorial update easier to write!) NB\+: same update to D3D renderer modules will follow some time soon.
\item Added\+: Rapid\+X\+ML based X\+ML parser module contributed by Jay Sprenkle. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=358}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=358}} and \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=4822}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=5\&t=4822}}.
\item Added\+: D3\+D11 Renderer code contributed by e3d\+\_\+alive. This requires the updated 0.\+7.\+x-\/r2 dependency packs to build. Note that while the /build/ is tested and seems ok, currently the code itself is completely untested (will try to add a samples base app to test this over the weekend or next week).
\item Added\+: Function to Irrlicht\+Geometry\+Buffer to retrieve the irr\+::video\+::\+S\+Material associated with the Geometry\+Buffer. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=363}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=363}}
\item Added\+: Ability to specify initial mouse cursor position.
\item Added\+: Function to allow explicit setting of the size at which to render the mouse cursor image. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=356}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=356}}
\item Added\+: Ogre\+Tray skin -\/ a recreation of the Ogre\+S\+D\+K\+Trays UI as used in the Ogre samples.
\item Added\+: Function to Ogre\+Renderer that allows client code to change the Ogre\+::\+Render\+Target associated with the default rendering root. Thanks to kornerr for suggesting and testing ;)
\item Added\+: Minizip\+Resource\+Provider code as contributed by Jamarr (See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=345}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=345}}) Also adding C++-\/ified versions of \textquotesingle{}unzip\textquotesingle{} parts of Minizip project needed by the above.
\item Added\+: Added new \textquotesingle{}utf8string\textquotesingle{} type to tolua++cegui so we can support utf8 string data in lua scripts. For\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=302}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=302}}
\item Added\+: Setting to control whether unhandled mouse input should be propagated back to the parent Window. This is the code side of the fix for\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=318}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=318}}. Looknfeel updates (which will make the fix \textquotesingle{}work\textquotesingle{}) to follow shortly.
\item Added\+: C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Ogre\+Renderer\+::initialise\+Render\+State\+Settings() function added in order to allow user to re-\/initialise the render states that C\+E\+G\+UI uses (and without any fear of the dreaded Ogre\+::\+Render\+System\+::\+\_\+begin\+Frame double-\/call).
\item Added\+: The following support to Section specifications in Falagard\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item control\+Value attribute\+: specifies an optional \textquotesingle{}test\textquotesingle{} value that the control\+Property\textquotesingle{}s fetched value will be compared against when determining whether to render the section (if they match it is draw, otherwise it\textquotesingle{}s not). If this is empty the property is treaed as boolean (as before).
\item control\+Widget attribute\+: specifies an optional widget identifier that will be used as the source of the property named by control\+Property. This can be a child widget suffix or the special \textquotesingle{}{\bfseries{parent}}\textquotesingle{} value. If this is empty, the window being drawn is used as the source (as before).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Ability for Property\+Link\+Definition to create links back to the parent window via a special widget value of {\bfseries{parent}}
\item Added\+: \textquotesingle{}end lock\textquotesingle{} mode to Scrollbar. With this mode enabled the Scrollbar will automatically maintain it\textquotesingle{}s position at the end of the scrollbar\textquotesingle{}s travel (useful to implement auto-\/scrolling of content). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=315}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=315}}
\item Added\+: Scrollbar\+::set\+Config function allowing updating of multiple parts of the Scrollbar configuration at once (which allows the user to avoid triggering multiple unneccessary updates). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=316}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=316}}
\item Added\+: New Property\+Link\+Target support to Property\+Link\+Definition. This new support allows a one to many mapping for property links, allowing a single property on a containing window to update multiple child properties simultaneously. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=4666}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=5\&t=4666}}
\item Added\+: M\+S\+V\+C++ / premake setting to allow some of the debug build S\+TL iterator checks to be disabled, thus giving performance improvements to debug builds. Generally these checks would only be useful for people debugging C\+E\+G\+UI itself, though they\textquotesingle{}re still on by default -\/ at least for now. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4630}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4630}}
\item Added\+: C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Null\+Renderer -\/ useful for hdealess testing of C\+E\+G\+UI. Written by Eugene Marcotte (thanks!)
\item Added\+: New window update mode setting that allows some control over the calling of the Window\+::update function. This defaults to W\+U\+M\+\_\+\+V\+I\+S\+I\+B\+LE for most window types, which is a large optimisation. Many thanks to Jabberwocky. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4500}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=3\&t=4500}}
\item Added\+: Window\+::move\+In\+Front and Window\+::move\+Behind functions to allow fine grained control over the z-\/ordering of sibling windows. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=300}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=300}}
\item Added\+: Provision to premake system to support addition of custom header and library search paths to any C\+E\+G\+UI project. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4616}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4616}}
\item Added\+: Add option in premake files to allow static builds of C\+E\+G\+UI to link against the D\+LL based dependencies and C/\+C++ runtime. This helps some integration issues with other libs. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4618}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4618}} (my posts)
\item Added\+: Facility in Window\+Renderer interface to allow subclasses to indicate whether registered properties should be added to the \textquotesingle{}ban\textquotesingle{} list for the target window.
\item Added\+: New Line\+Spacing attribute for Free\+Type style fonts allowing override of line spacing in underlying font files. From patch by \textquotesingle{}codeka\textquotesingle{}. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4605}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=3\&t=4605}} and \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=326}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=326}}
\item Added\+: Support for \textquotesingle{}Render\+Effect\textquotesingle{} attribute / setting on Falagard mapped types -\/ allows automatic setup of render effects specified in schemes.
\item Added\+: New Render\+Effect\+Manager singleton to act as a means to register Render\+Effects with the system in a central place. This will eventually be used with the scheme system to allow effects to be specified there.
\item Added\+: Lua support for function Listbox\+::get\+Item\+At\+Point (actual binding needs regenerating, will come later after other possible updates to packages).
\item Added\+: Notification message to Open\+GL renderer ID string when gl\+Blend\+Func\+Separate support is missing.
\item Added\+: Add options to premake build that allow control over which build configurations will be available in the solution / project files.
\item Deleted\+: Removed Right\+Window enumerated value from C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Key\+::\+Scan enumeration. Sorry if this breaks your stuff, but we needed this!
\item Deleted\+: Remove unneeded \textquotesingle{}keepme\textquotesingle{} files left over from the C\+VS days.
\item Deleted\+: Remove the premake batch files for the unsupported 2002 version compiler.
\item Documentation\+: Remove reference to premake 3.\+1 and link to our custom premake instead.
\item Documentation\+: Add documentation file that has licensing info for the media files.
\item Documentation\+: Fix issue where we referenced non-\/existent class. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=331}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=331}} NB\+: Will upload fixed version to docs/current later on today.
\item Documentation\+: Fix issues where references were made to incorrect or non-\/existant classes. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=330}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=330}} NB\+: Will upload fixed version to docs/current later on today.
\item Documentation\+: Update event name documentation with information about the specific Event\+Args subclass that gets passed to subscibed event handlers. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=321}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=321}}
\item Documentation\+: Misc. minor fixes and updates to some of the docs.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Release 0.\+7.\+1}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure --includedir configure option is respected.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue of Window\textquotesingle{}s local Geometry\+Buffer translation not being reset when Window gets given a surface after initial creation.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue of Window\textquotesingle{}s Rendering\+Window rotation pivot point not getting updated as window\textquotesingle{}s area size changes.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue of rendering window surfaces not getting correctly transferred under all circumstances.
\item Bug Fix\+: Double-\/deletion of non-\/system created Image\+Codec when linking statically. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4414}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4414}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Do not log non-\/errors as errors when using minibidi. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4356}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4356}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Multi\+Column\+List bug where row inserted into sorted list was not passing on input row\+\_\+id value.
\item Bug Fix\+: Static builds linked (incorrectly) against runtime D\+L\+Ls. This is now fixed.
\item Bug Fix\+: Change the size calculations for the editbox portion in the Widget\+Look definitions for the Combobox. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=4382}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=9\&t=4382}}
\item Bug Fix\+: update package config files to specify the correct library names when a build suffix is used.
\item Bug Fix\+: Open\+GL based texture targets would fail after calls to grab\+Textures / restore\+Textures. NB\+: Still to test fix on Apple and W\+GL.
\item Bug Fix\+: in Open\+GL Texture, only allow a single grab\+Texture to occur.
\item Bug Fix\+: Unified\+Max\+Size property had incorrect default value string. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=313}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=313}}
\item Bug Fix\+: For Unified metrics, in the divide by zero case, set the compoent part to zero (not correct, but maybe argued better than doing nothing). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4403}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=3\&t=4403}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Set size on dialogs in the Scrollable\+Pane demo in order that the drag-\/sizing code works right \+:-\/p
\item Bug Fix\+: Scrollable\+Pane issues\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Broken hit-\/testing of content initially outside the view pane (this was broken in 0.\+7.\+0 when inner-\/rect fix was made).
\item Broken relative co-\/ords of added content (incorrectly used size of content pane as base rather than Scrollable\+Pane inner-\/rect).
\item Broken positioning of (0, 0) point of content pane (prevented content from being offset correctly).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure base co-\/ords used for window to screen conversions are pixel aligned. This fixes issues caused by per-\/window geometry buffer translations (and associated clippers) not being pixel aligned and causing blurred imagery.
\item Bug Fix\+: Remove redundant offset translation from Open\+GL renderer module (was not doing anything because it should have been before the \textquotesingle{}get\textquotesingle{}, but this offset is not needed anyway).
\item Bug Fix\+: issue in Multi\+Line\+Editbox where caret position gets messed up when backspace deleting the last character.
\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure looknfeel based content (auto window content) is layed out prior to notifying other content about size changes, this is required because the inner-\/rect area may rely on the size or position of this auto window content.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue where C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Window check for size change did not consider the fact that although the outer rect has not changed, the inner rect still may have -\/ for example as a result of imagery auto-\/scaling.
\item Bug Fix\+: Textures in cached geometry may become invalid after a display / host window resize, so we must ensure all cached geometry is regenerated by invalidating all windows.
\item Bug Fix\+: Window rect area / window position would not always be updated when using alignments other than top/left.
\item Bug Fix\+: Updates required to work with Irrlicht 1.\+6 final release. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4393}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4393}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: X\+M\+L\+Parser\+::initialise was not being called when linking statically.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue where a root G\+U\+I\+Sheet with mouse pass through enabled would still consume a mouse button down event if the window was not already active. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=309}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=309}}
\item Bug Fix\+: D3\+D9 renderer was not setting View matrix back to identity prior to rendering, thus allowing potential funkiness to ensue ;)
\item Bug Fix\+: Minor tweak so premake scripts work correctly when using premake 3.\+7.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue where window positions with purely absolute positioning would not trigger update of the the Geometry\+Buffer translation vector under various circumstances. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4365}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4365}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: In M\+CL insertion point when adding content to a sorted list did not correctly take into account the sort direction. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4360}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=3\&t=4360}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve issue where a non-\/splitting Rendered\+String\+Component could cause a hang in the Rendered\+String\+Word\+Wrapper class. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=306}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=306}}
\item Bug Fix\+: The Editbox classes would incorrectly parse the input text and potentially cause exceptions based upon user input (See\+: See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=308}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=308}}). This fix is a multi-\/part enhancement in order to correctly and cleanly enable effective disabling of parsing, consisting of the following\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add static Default\+Rendered\+String\+Parser to Window for use when normal parsing is disabled.
\item Add member functions, property and event based around enabling and disabling text parsing.
\item Update editbox classes to disable parsing by default.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve issue with Frame\+Window content layout for cases where Frame\+Window is initially hidden. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4357}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4357}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve (hopefully, anyway) issues relating to our not checking for support for N\+P\+OT textures in the Open\+GL renderer (NB\+: W\+G\+L\+P\+Buffer versio still to be tested). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=307}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=307}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Irrlicht renderer issues where driver capabilities were not checked correctly before using possibly unsupported facilities. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=305}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=305}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue of Multi\+Line\+Editbox not being initialised correctly (no initial terminating ~\newline
 being set). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=304}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=304}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Do not optimise debug build on the Mac.
\item Bug Fix\+: Fix incorrect S\+VN U\+R\+Ls in documentation.
\item Bug Fix\+: Crash in Ogre based texture target, where we may inadvertently restore a deleted viewport to the render system.
\item Modified\+: Introduce Open\+G\+L\+Texture\+Target common base class for all the various texture targets supported.
\item Modified\+: Allow use of alternative names for named areas in the Listbox Widget\+Look (looknfeel). This allows unified names for Listbox and Item\+Listbox in order that the same Widget\+Look definition may be used for both. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=314}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=314}}
\item Modified\+: Correct license information in the Tree\+Demo files.
\item Modified\+: Update license info from L\+G\+PL to M\+IT (change applied with original author\textquotesingle{}s permission).
\item Modified\+: Updated the Groupbox license to M\+IT. This has been approved by Levia, the author.
\item Modified\+: Changes to Font\+Demo\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Auto load all fonts in resource group \char`\"{}fonts\char`\"{}
\item Each language now has a \textquotesingle{}preferred font\textquotesingle{} name specified.
\item Language only shows in list if preferred font is loaded.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Modified\+: Allow Window subclasses to override the code that sets the various window region rect areas (inner, outer, clippers and hit-\/test).
\item Modified\+: Update C\+E\+G\+UI premake system for use with static dependency libraries in static builds. I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+NT N\+O\+TE\+: All M\+S\+V\+C++ users -\/ you M\+U\+ST now use the new 0.\+7.\+x-\/r1 dependency packages and not the previous 0.\+7.\+x packs.
\item Modified\+: Optimise Frame\+Widow drag-\/sizing code so that Window\+::set\+Area\+\_\+impl is not called twice when a sizing operaion involves two edges.
\item Modified\+: Some optimisations in Falagard Static\+Text renderer to reduce unneccessary text formatting calls (which have the potential to be very expensive).
\item Added\+: Functions to Drag\+Container to support a custom fixed offset from which the container will always be dragged from.
\item Added\+: Drag\+Container\+::pick\+Up function to allow user code to programatically pick up a sticky mode Drag\+Container. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4406}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4406}}
\item Added\+: Definitions for Combobox and Progressbar in Vanilla looknfeel and scheme.
\item Added\+: Optional extended input event injectors for mouse button click, double-\/click and triple-\/click events. NB\+: Lua bindind needs regenerating. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=299}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=299}}.
\item Added\+: Setting to System to disable the automatic generation of mouse button click, double-\/click and triple-\/click events.
\item Added\+: Package config file for C\+E\+G\+UI / Ogre. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=312}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=312}}.
\item Added\+: Basic math operator overloads to U\+Vector2 that take a single U\+Dim. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4403}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=3\&t=4403}}
\item Added\+: Window\+::invalidate(const bool) function to enable recursiv invalidation of all child content for a window as well as the window itself. NB\+: This function replaces the old Window\+::invalidate function (with no args), which is now deprecated and will be removed at some future time (circa 0.\+8.\+x)
\item Added\+: New events Frame\+Window\+::\+Event\+Drag\+Sizing\+Started and Frame\+Window\+::\+Event\+Drag\+Sizing\+Ended.
\item Added\+: User configurable System level global custom Rendered\+String\+Parser to be used whenever parsing is enabled and no custom parser is set for a window.
\item Added\+: Expanded tags supported in Basic\+Rendered\+String\+Parser to expose the existing padding and vertical alignment support, and to add support for specifying image dimensions.
\item Added\+: Vert\+Extent and Horz\+Extent properties added to Falagard Static\+Text renderer to return current pixel extents of formatted text. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4363}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=10\&t=4363}}
\item Deleted\+: Remove Commonwealth, Iconified and Sword fonts due to possible licensing issues.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Window system now caching at the geometry level, eliminating vast amounts of redraw calculations.
\item Support for caching imagery to texture, eliminating large amounts of redraw work.
\item Support for targeting Window sub-\/heirarchies to separate rendering surfaces (still many user-\/friendliness work and other fixes to do here).
\item Support for a Render\+Effect system allowing custom geometric and shader based effects for Window objects.
\item Support for three axis rotation of texture backed Windows and other Geometry\+Buffer content.
\item Additional notes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removes\+: Support for D3D 8.\+1 based renderer.
\item Removes\+: Support for compiling against Irrlicht versions below 1.\+4.
\item Direct\+FB support currently broken.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added new string rendering enhancements, current version provides\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Extensible Rendered\+String\+Parser system.
\item Base support for parsing formatting tags in strings\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Support for \mbox{[}font\mbox{]} tag to enable multiple fonts per text string.
\item Support for \mbox{[}colour\mbox{]} tag to enable multiple colours per text string.
\item Support for \mbox{[}image\mbox{]} tag to enable embedding of images in strings.
\item Support for \mbox{[}window\mbox{]} tag to enable aligning child window/widget content in-\/line with other string rendering.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Added \textquotesingle{}sticky\textquotesingle{} mode to Drag\+Container. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=129}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=129}}
\item Added\+: Common optional Falagard based Named\+Area of \textquotesingle{}inner\+\_\+rect\textquotesingle{} that is looked up and used for the inner/client area of a window (unless other specific named areas are used by a specialised Window\+Renderer). Final addition for\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=260}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=260}}.
\item Added\+: Option for the caret used with Editbox and Multi\+Line\+Editbox to blink with an adjustable timeout / blink period. Implemented for\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=227}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=227}}
\item Added\+: possibility for time based update of a Window\+Renderer (allows WR based animation / automation).
\item Added\+: option to disable building the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Default\+Logger object. NB\+: In this case a suitable alternative must be provided and instantiated prior to creating the main C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+System object. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=243}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=243}}
\item Added\+: Option to disable the use of the freetype2 external library. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=240}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=240}}
\item Added\+: Option to configure C\+E\+G\+UI so that it does not require the P\+C\+RE dependency (disabling this will cause attempts to set the validation string -\/ such as what the spinner does in it\textquotesingle{}s constructor -\/ to throw Invalid\+Request\+Exception). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=241}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=241}}
\item Added\+: Option to autotools build to enable some configuration of the version suffix that\textquotesingle{}s now appended on those builds.
\item Added\+: Option to autotools build to specify a general suffix that\textquotesingle{}s added to the name of binary output for autotools builds. This enables the installation of multiple versions based upon different configuration and build options (similar to what we have with M\+S\+V\+C++ and the \+\_\+d suffix for debug builds). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=274}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=274}}
\item Added\+: Facility for resource system to load all resources matching a given pattern from a specified resource group (on a per resource type basis). For\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=190}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=190}}
\item Added\+: Add property to Xerces\+Parser to access the default schema resource group (allows setting of this without needing to explicitly link to Xerces\+Parser module lib).
\item Added\+: Event notification via Window\+Manager for Window object creation and destruction.
\item Added\+: Added bi-\/directional text support contributed by Assaf Raman. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=268}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=268}}. NB\+: Not supported by Multi\+Line\+Editbox (yet).
\item Added\+: Implementation of an Image\+Codec that goes via the Ogre image loading facilities. NB\+: This is provided as an \textquotesingle{}integrated\textquotesingle{} class as opposed to a loadable module since it\textquotesingle{}s a more consistent approach for an engine specific entity such as this.
\item Added\+: Implementation of an Image\+Codec that goes via the Irrlicht image loading facilities. NB\+: This is provided as an \textquotesingle{}integrated\textquotesingle{} class as opposed to a loadable module since it\textquotesingle{}s a more consistent approach for an engine specific entity such as this.
\item Added\+: Support for adding Window\+Renderer\+Factory objects via a template function to allow C\+E\+G\+UI to create and manage the factory instances (rather than having to have them pre-\/created).
\item Added\+: Dialog based implementation of a renderer selector for the Mac.
\item Added\+: M\+S\+V\+C++ 2008 batch files for project generation, cause the premake support seems to work.
\item Added\+: Event notifications for main resource actions (create, destroy, replace).
\item Added\+: Doxygen based supporting documentation and tutorials.
\item Added\+: Doxygen based version of Falagard skinning documentation (which will now become the only maintained version of that material).
\item Added\+: Template based system for Window\+Factory creation\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removes the need to manually create supporting structure when adding new Window types.
\item Dispenses with the need to use the macro nastiness previously employed.
\item No longer need to have statically created factories laying around.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Apply patch\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=275}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=275}} that adds some extra support for Tree\+Item to the lua module.
\item Removed\+: deprecated Window\+::do\+Rise\+On\+Click function.
\item Removed\+: Formatting related functions from Font.
\item Removed\+: Duplicate text formatting enumerations -\/ now using a single version (the Horizontal\+Text\+Formatting and Vertical\+Text\+Formatting enums in the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Fal\+Enums.\+h file)
\item Removed\+: Apple specific version of resource setup in samples (no longer required due to other improvements).
\item Modified\+: Changed key handling in editbox classes to allow user subscribed events to \textquotesingle{}consume\textquotesingle{} keys and prevent the usual processing from occuring.
\item Modified\+: C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Exception to derive from std\+::exception (for\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=4267}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=5\&t=4267}} and others from waaay back).
\item Modified\+: Made C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Lua\+Script\+Module constructor / destructor private -\/ access is now via Lua\+Script\+Module\+::create and Lua\+Script\+Module\+::destroy static functions.
\item Modified\+: Made C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+System constructor / destructor private -\/ access is now via System\+::create and System\+::destroy static functions. Additionally, first parameter changed from being a Renderer pointer to a Renderer reference (reinforces that it may not be 0).
\item Modified\+: Switched to a single unified constructor for Lua\+Script\+Module.
\item Modified\+: Change names of renderer modules and libs produced under premake/\+M\+S\+V\+C++ to match those produced by other methods (i.\+e. C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Open\+G\+L\+Renderer instead of Open\+G\+L\+G\+U\+I\+Renderer)
\item Modified\+: Change access protection on C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Tree\+::get\+Item\+At\+Point from protected to public. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=15576\#15576}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?p=15576\#15576}}
\item Modified\+: Switch from libtool A\+BI versioning to release versioning. This is related to this\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=197}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=197}} in reagrd to our continual breaking changes, but also solves issues of plugin/loadable module version conflicts, and effectively allows side-\/by-\/side installations of multiple versions of the binary.
\item Modified\+: Prevent copy and assignment for Singleton based objects (the compiler error helps people spot common usgae mistakes). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=203}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=203}}
\item Modified\+: Changed the system default \textquotesingle{}single-\/click\textquotesingle{} timeout from 0.\+2 to 0 (infinite). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=209}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=209}}
\item Modified\+: Changed default state of inherited tooltip text from false to true. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=204}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=204}}
\item Modified\+: Replaced the old config file support with something more comprehensive and useful. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=189}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=189}}
\item Modified\+: Disable optimisation in the Release\+With\+Symbols config. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=293}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=293}}
\item Modified\+: Made Listbox\+Item\+::set\+Text virtual.
\item Modified\+: Free\+Type\+Font to output more detailed error info when creating a font face fails.
\item Modified\+: X\+M\+L\+Parser now becomes a Property\+Set.
\item Modified\+: Relax requirement that the target of a window alias exists before creating the alias.
\item Modified\+: Relax requirement to have imageset / font names specified in schemes along with the names of files.
\item Modified\+: Simplify and (largely) unify resource group initialisation for sample base apps.
\item Modified\+: Added build and system information to the logged version string.
\item Modified\+: Window\+::is\+Hit (and some other related funcs) has an added boolean to allow disabled windows to be correctly hit-\/tested when needed.
\item Modified\+: Changed the way that a \textquotesingle{}Window Renderer Set\textquotesingle{} loadable module is composed. Moving away from using a macro based approach to a class based approach. This makes creation of these modules much easier and cleaner; it\textquotesingle{}s also more transparent, since everyone understands classes, whereas probably nobody knew what was going on behind those macros!
\item Modified\+: Update the Falagard window renderer set to use the new class based specification system.
\item Modified\+: Completely replaced old Xcode project with a new one.
\item Modified\+: Rewrote Mac bundle loading to look in \textquotesingle{}Plug\+Ins\textquotesingle{} locations instead of \textquotesingle{}Resources\textquotesingle{} locations.
\item Modified\+: Change Sample base application so that on that Mac it successfully fetches the path of the datafiles directory within the app bundles Resources (now we don\textquotesingle{}t have to rely on working directory being unmodified).
\item Modified\+: Core resource loading (Scheme, Font, Imageset) to support differing actions based upon loading a resource with a name that already exists in the system.
\item Modified\+: Regular expression library use abstracted via C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Regex\+Matcher (available internally only at the moment!)
\item Modified\+: P\+C\+RE usage now via a P\+C\+RE based implementation of C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Regex\+Matcher.
\item Modified\+: Internal Window class changes to (try to) overcome confusing usage of all those d\+\_\+screen$\ast$ rect members and a bunch of getters with unclear names\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item get\+Unclipped\+Pixel\+Rect is renamed to get\+Unclipped\+Outer\+Rect
\item get\+Unclipped\+Inner\+Rect is unchanged.
\item get\+Pixel\+Rect is renamed to get\+Outer\+Rect\+Clipper and is intended only for the use of rendering calculations.
\item get\+Inner\+Rect is renamed to get\+Inner\+Rect\+Clipper and is (again) intended only for the use of rendering calculations.
\item Added a get\+Unclipped\+Rect function that can return either inner or outer area dependant upon the value passed.
\item Added a get\+Clip\+Rect function that can return either inner or outer area dependant upon the values passed.
\item Added a new area specifically for hit testing and such, fetched with get\+Hit\+Test\+Rect. NB\+: This was added since the other area rects are not reliable for hit testing due to the fact things may or may not being clipped when rendered to a texture target.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Modified\+: Input injection and Event changes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+System no longer propogates input events (those that are injected) recursively. C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Window will however do this for key events by default.
\item C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Window marks all mouse input events as handled by default.
\item C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+G\+U\+I\+Sheet (Default\+Window) overrides the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Window mouse handling to not mark events handled if the G\+U\+I\+Sheet is a root window with mouse passthrough enabled.
\item Event\+Args\+::handled member has changed type from bool to uint.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Modified\+: Complete restructuring of the source tree (for cleanup and improved consistency reasons, amongst other things).
\item Modified\+: Font\+Demo changes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added Vietnamese example text.
\item Added Japanese and Korean text + fonts
\item Select a default valid font when selecting a different language
\item Changed font in language list, because one was invisible (missing glyphs)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Modified\+: Warn user during samples premake, when both D\+X9 and D\+X10 are defined for static builds.
\item Bug Fix\+: issue where invalid values were accepted by Window\+::set\+Alpha, causing renderer dependent problems.
\item Bug Fix\+: issue with Tree\+::get\+Next\+Selected\+Item\+From\+List not processing branches correctly. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4239}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?f=3\&t=4239}}
\item Bug Fix\+: fixed up the relative paths used in local header include statements for public headers.
\item Bug Fix\+: static build issues with image codec choice.
\item Bug Fix\+: Ensure to initialise all Lua\+Script\+Module fields in the constructor.
\item Bug Fix\+: Improve cleanup of script module in Demo8 to make it safe!
\item Bug Fix\+: permit mouse enters / mouse leaves type events for disabled windows. Fixes\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=292}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=292}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Made implementation data in Falagard\+Editbox protected.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue where use of lua 5.\+1 with the binding generator explicitly required lua to have been built with L\+U\+A\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+A\+T\+\_\+\+V\+A\+R\+A\+RG defined. This fixes the issue, but removes compatibility with the old lua 5.\+0 version. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=211}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=211}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Isse where some Font accessor functions were non-\/const. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=199}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=199}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: resolve warnings about discarded return type qualifiers.
\item Bug Fix\+: resolved issue where spinner would use scientific notation, and also suffer various other precision related anomolies (now using modified function from stringencoders lib). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=123}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=123}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve a load of warnings and C++ standards compliancy issues.
\item Bug Fix\+: Correct a whole load of E\+OL issues.

\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Release 0.\+6.\+2}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Support for Tree\+Event\+Args in the lua scripting module (patch from kripken, \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3704}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?t=3704}})
\item Added\+: Scrolled\+Item\+List\+Base\+::ensure\+Item\+Is\+Visible\+Vert and Scrolled\+Item\+List\+Base\+::ensure\+Item\+Is\+Visible\+Horz members to allow scrolling lists programmatically to ensure a specified item is visible. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=228}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=228}}
\item Added\+: Added ability to specify a function to be used as the error handler in calls to lua\+\_\+pcall. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=239}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=239}}
\item Added\+: G\+UI Renderer module and supporting samples base app for Direct\+FB (\href{http://www.directfb.org/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+directfb.\+org/}}). Contributed by Keith Mok. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=233}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=233}}. Needs additional testing! S\+K\+IP ON M\+E\+R\+GE -\/ trunk will get it\textquotesingle{}s own version via the mantis patch (then be rewritten for the new renderer model).
\item Added\+: Member to C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Tree\+Item to allow removal of sub-\/items. see\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=15563\#15563}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?p=15563\#15563}}
\item Added\+: Templatised add\+Factory static function to Window\+Factory manager that allows the system to create -\/ and therefore own -\/ custom window factory objects; thus alleviating potential cleanup issues when using custom factories. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=249}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=249}}.
\item Modified\+: Modify Tree\+::set\+Item\+Select\+State(\+Tree\+Item$\ast$ item, bool state) to recurively check subitems also (else we fail when trying to set the selected state on a second level (or greater) item). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=16197\#16197}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?p=16197\#16197}}
\item Modified\+: Forward C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Script\+Exception from within the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+System script execution functions as opposed to translating them into less useful C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Generic\+Exception. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3595}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?t=3595}}
\item Modified\+: Enhanced existing logging to include memory addresses when an object is created or destroyed (for most objects). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=224}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=224}}
\item Modified\+: Added warning to Window\+Manager\+::load\+Window\+Layout documentation regarding possible invocation of incorrect overload when using a C string literal for the \textquotesingle{}name\+\_\+prefix\textquotesingle{}. (Issue is to be resolved in trunk. Maintaining A\+BI and A\+PI compatibility with previous v0-\/6 releases prevents a fix in this branch).
\item Modified\+: Tree Code / documentation reformatting, correction and cleanup.
\item Modified\+: Mark Tree and related classes as deprecated.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue in Combo\+Drop\+List would cause Invalid\+Request\+Exception whenever input capture was lost and the highlighted item was different to the last click-\/selected item. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3693}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?t=3693}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Disable M\+S\+V\+C++ 4251 warning coming from C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Tree\+Item.\+h
\item Bug Fix\+: Event connection objects returned to lua subscribe\+Event calls did not have the connected or disconnect members available for use (making the connection object useless).
\item Bug Fix\+: Tiny\+X\+ML parse failures were going unchecked. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3688}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?t=3688}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Lua script module based \textquotesingle{}execute\+Scripted\+Event\+Handler was still not returning correct value (missed when I did the Lua\+Functor version of the same, see\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=225}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=225}} for original issue).
\item Bug Fix\+: Hopefully resolve issue where the use of Free\+Image codec could result in pixel format of loaded data being incorrect. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=230}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=230}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: There was an issue where Windows could be created during system destruction -\/ this fixes that by introducing a \textquotesingle{}locked\textquotesingle{} state for Window\+Manager whereby any attempt to create a Window throws an Invalid\+Request\+Exception. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=250}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=250}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Script\+Module bindings were destroyed out of sequence meaning event handlers could still be fired that needed C\+E\+G\+UI bindings to exist. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=245}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=245}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: The functionality of the \char`\"{}rise on click\char`\"{} setting was totally broken (prize for longest standing issue?). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=244}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=244}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: When using the scrollwheel to change a C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Slider value, the direction of movement was the opposite to what would have been expected. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=238}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=238}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Property\+Dim documentation did not reflect the updated abilities of the class, and the documentation for the argument \textquotesingle{}type\textquotesingle{} was not clear about how it should be used with regards to affecting interpretation of the property accessed. Related to\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=247}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=247}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Endian problem with C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::colour. This change should fix this\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=229}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=229}}
\item Bug Fix\+: The Window\+::get\+Child(const C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+String\&) function was incorrectly made recursive after the 0.\+5.\+x series of releases. This fix restores the correct behaviour and adds a Window\+::get\+Child\+Recursive(const C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+String\&) function for the highly expensive recursive case. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=237}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=237}}
\item Bug Fix\+: The C++ side of the lua based event mechanism would always return true as if the event were handled, even if some other boolean value (i.\+e. false) were returned from the lua side. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=225}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=225}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve issue where events were still being injected into an invisible G\+UI sheet / root window. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=226}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=226}}
\item Bug Fix\+: null window pointers to add/remove functions of Tab\+Control were unchecked and would cause crashes. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=232}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=232}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve incompatibility issue with Xerces-\/\+C++ 3. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=235}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=235}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Window\+::get\+Child and Window\+::recursive\+Child\+Search would use the starting window\textquotesingle{}s prefix when testing the prefix + name case, this is incorrect and should have been using the prefix of the child being tested (load 2 windows from layouts, using different prefixes. Add the second layout to the first as a child, then call get\+Child on the first layout window, passing the name of the second layout window, prior to the fix the call would have failed to find the child).
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve inconsistency where Window\+::is\+Child did not consider the Window name prefix, whereas Window\+::get\+Child did. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=215}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=215}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Potential crash regarding sorted column ID, when queried by the property system.
\item Bug Fix\+: the value returned by System\+::get\+Window\+Containing\+Mouse was only updated when the mouse was moved, this caused potenial issues when windows were moved, sized, created, destroyed, or had their visible or enabled states changed. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=213}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=213}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Programmatically made changes to Combobox selection were not reflected in the Editbox component of the Combobox. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=220}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=220}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Vector out of bounds in Window\+::update (see\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=221}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=221}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Win32 helper did not consider window farme / decorations when creating windows, so the client area was always smaller than requested. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=15524}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?p=15524}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: \textquotesingle{}else\textquotesingle{} within preprocessor conditional sections with no guarantee that there was a prior \textquotesingle{}if\textquotesingle{}. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=15524}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?p=15524}}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Fix a couple of minor rendering issues with Taharez\+Look/\+Progress\+Bar.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolves a bug where the progress content was drawn into, rather than clipped by, the intersection of the the full progress area and the current progress area. N\+O\+TE\+: People relying on the old buggy behaviour can reproduce the same effect by multiplying appropriate part(s) of thier imagery area definitions by the \char`\"{}\+Current\+Progress\char`\"{} property in their looknfeel files.
\item Bug Fix\+: Min\+GW configure/make was not building with glew correctly.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue with Tree related properties casting to Listbox. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=218}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=218}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve issue where iterator at begining of range was decremented uncheked. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3408}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?t=3408}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Release 0.\+6.\+1}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Batch files to invoke premake for V\+C9 files (seems to work fine)
\item Added\+: Added a supported value to represent infinity to enable the click generation timouts to be set to \char`\"{}no timeout\char`\"{}. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=208}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=208}}
\item Added\+: Added Window\+::append\+Text and Window\+::insert\+Text member functions. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=195}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=195}}
\item Added\+: Initial version of a sample base application using Direct3D 10.
\item Added\+: Initial code for the D3D 10 G\+UI Renderer, originally contributed by Rajko Stojadinovic. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2919}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?t=2919}}
\item Added\+: Irrlich\+Renderer had no facility for notifying of display size changes. This adds a set\+Display\+Size member for that purpose. (Part of fixes for\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=187}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=187}}).
\item Added\+: Logging of renderer resize event notifications (prelim work for issue\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=187}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=187}})
\item Added\+: New drag and drop demo. Originally written to aid in debugging of an issue, but is otherwise useful as an example \+:)
\item Added\+: Added F\+PS readout in sample base app for Irrlicht. (See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=176}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=176}}).
\item Modified\+: Changed Xcode build for the renderer frameworks so that headers retain their original subdirectory location; this aids in keeping client code portable.
\item Modified\+: Refactored tab removal code to eliminate repetition.
\item Modified\+: On linux, use installed system versions of tolua++ and Tiny\+X\+ML libraries if available (can be disabled to force continued use of internal versions). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=198}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=198}}
\item Major update of Mac Xcode project. This attempts to achieve the following\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Update all existing targets in relation to added and removed source files.
\item Resolved some minor issues with custom scripts when rebuilding up to date targets.
\item Added targets for Demo6, Demo7, Demo8, Drag\+Drop\+Demo, Instanced\+Windows, Text\+Demo and Tree\+Demo (completing the set).
\item Added target for ceguitolua++ framework (needed for lua support and for lua samples to run).
\item Use of precompiled dependencies package from within local tree (upload to follow shortly, pending resolution of final remaining issues).
\item Dependency frameworks will now be embedded within whichever component uses them (as opposed to needing separate installation).
\item Sample apps now correctly work with embedded C\+E\+G\+UI frameworks and so should run anywhere without additional installation.
\item Modify samples app packaging to symlink the frameworks and datafiles, as opposed to actually copying -\/ this vastly reduces the footprint of the development directory (at a small cost of flexibility).
\item symlink the output sample apps into the ./\+Samples/bin directory (using subdirs for each config)
\item Added required define in C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Config.\+h for Lua support
\item Updated default Image\+Codec in C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Config.\+h to be S\+I\+L\+LY
\item Big cleanup of the various targets so that common settings (virtually all settings, actually) can be set once at the project level rather than needing to be set separately on each target.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Bug Fix\+: Deleting/removing a menu item from a menu when the item had an active popup would result in a dangling pointer to the deleted/removed item.
\item Bug Fix\+: line endings and set missing svn\+:eol-\/style on all Tree related code files.
\item Bug Fix\+: Injection of mouse movements and mouse positions which did not actually reflect a change of mouse cursor position were still firing events and triggering side effects. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=202}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=202}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Item\+Listbox\+::remove\+Item() was not checking if removed item was the one referenced in d\+\_\+last\+Selected, so was leaving a dangling pointer. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=206}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=206}}
\item Bug Fix\+: The docs for the list widgets stated that the insert member would insert anitem after a given item, whereas the widget actually inserted the item before the given item. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=205}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=205}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Exception message in post\+D3\+D\+Reset member of the D3D renderers was incorrectly stating the exception as coming from from pre\+D3\+D\+Reset. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=207}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=207}}
\item Bug Fix\+: double deletion issue in Corona based Image\+Codec.
\item Bug Fix\+: Mac\+Renderer\+Selector had uninitialised member variable, causing incorrect behaviour.
\item Bug Fix\+: C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Samples\+Config.\+h is for Mac only now -\/ removed conditionals that would bring in these options for Win32 (which uses premake).
\item Bug Fix\+: Fixed comment blocks to eliminate a constant stream of warnings (gcc) when building anything C\+E\+G\+UI related.
\item Bug Fix\+: Need to bring in C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Config.\+h when building C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Lua.\+cpp in case we\textquotesingle{}re on a Mac.
\item Bug Fix\+: Bug in C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Dev\+I\+L\+Image\+Codec in which I\+Linfo structure is not inititalised to 0s prior to usage, causing random crashes.
\item Bug Fix\+: inclusion of config.\+h M\+U\+ST be protected by a conditional that checks H\+A\+V\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+F\+I\+G\+\_\+H.
\item Bug Fix\+: Between the 0.\+5.\+0 and 0.\+6.\+0 releases the System\+::set\+Default\+X\+M\+L\+Parser\+Name function was bastardised to perform a function other than its intended purpose. This fix restores the intended behaviour of set\+Default\+X\+M\+L\+Parser\+Name and adds functions for setting the X\+ML parser after System instantiation correctly. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=186}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=186}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue of missing Open\+GL render state initialisation when multitexture support is available. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=201}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=201}}. NB\+: This also adds use of G\+L\+EW library (external (autotools) or embedded (all platforms)).
\item Bug Fix\+: uncomment part of cegui.\+lua configuration script that allows use of option to have Ogre in samples.
\item Bug Fix\+: pragmas for link libs in Ogre base app were incorrectly dependant on \+\_\+\+W\+I\+N32 macro instead of \+\_\+\+M\+S\+C\+\_\+\+V\+ER macro.
\item Bug Fix\+: Added extra pragma lines to bring in required O\+IS lib for the Ogre base app.
\item Bug Fix\+: Ogre base app now uses num\+Keyboards (was num\+Key\+Boards) from O\+IS; this is what the O\+IS from the Ogre deps expects.
\item Bug Fix\+: Fixed documentation for Mouse\+Button enumeration. Thanks to \textquotesingle{}alphasnd\textquotesingle{}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Update\+Event\+Args\+::d\+\_\+time\+Since\+Last\+Frame was not being initialised in constructor.
\item Bug Fix\+: Use linux Simple\+Timer\+::current\+Time for Apple Macs also. Thanks go to alphasnd, see\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3247}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?t=3247}}

\item Bug Fix\+: Tab\+Control was subscribing to Event\+Text\+Changed on added content windows, but not releasing the connection when the content window was removed -\/ causing Unknown\+Object exceptions and possible crashes when attempting to change the text on a window after it had been added to and then removed from a Tab\+Control. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=192}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=192}}
\item Bug Fix\+: When linking on autotools based systems, ensure we explicitly link with the \textquotesingle{}just built\textquotesingle{} versions of C\+E\+G\+UI libraries; this ensures that we are not inadvertently picking up old installed versions of the same libs.
\item Bug Fix\+: Updated Ogre base application to correctly respond to window resize events and inform the C\+E\+G\+UI renderer of the change. Part of fixes for\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=187}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=187}}

\item Bug Fix\+: Under gcc/autotools the various libraries and modules were not linking against C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Base (except on Min\+G\+W32). See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=196}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=196}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Update Irrlicht sample base application to notify the renderer of the display size -\/ in order that it may react properly to any changes. (Part of fixes for\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=187}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=187}}).
\item Bug Fix\+: When injecting mouse position change information using the System\+::inject\+Mouse\+Position member, the resulting Mouse\+Event\+Args structure passed to event handlers always had the positional change delta information set to 0. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=194}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=194}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Frame\+Window types had no realistic default minimum size specified, meaning the user could resize these windows to such an extent that they totally disappeared and we no longer usable. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=193}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=193}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue with detection and usage of glut library under Msys/\+Min\+GW. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=184}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=184}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Can\textquotesingle{}t get correct error string on Win32 platform when dynamic module load failed. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=178}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=178}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Missing winmm library dependency for Min\+G\+W32 autotool based builds. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=183}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=183}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Hiding the active window would leave the hidden window active and receiving inputs; it was also possible to activate a hidden window which is not logical. See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=188}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=188}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Time pulse injection under DirectX sample base app was either missing (DX 8.\+1) or broken (DX 9). (See\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=177}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=177}}).

\item Modified\+: Updated samples with new exception code
\item Modified\+: Applied large patches. For details see this thread\+: \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2766}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?t=2766}}
\item Modified\+: set\+Default\+X\+M\+L\+Parser\+Name now unloads the default dynamic module and loads a new one provided you are not statically linking.
\item Modified\+: tolua++cegui changes in exception handlers.
\item Modified\+: Large Premake updates
\item Coding Standards\+: C\+E\+G\+UI does not use the N\+U\+LL macro in code.
\item Coding Standards\+: the prefix used for data members on the C\+E\+G\+UI project is d\+\_\+ and not m\+\_\+
\item Bug Fix\+: Corona based image codec would not build.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolve a thousand and one \char`\"{}deprecated conversion from string constant to \textquotesingle{}char$\ast$\textquotesingle{}\char`\"{} warnings that spew forth from gcc 4.\+2.\+x.
\item Bug Fix\+: Lua 5.\+1 removes table.\+setn -\/ update code to use alternate method of ensuring table is indeed empty.
\item Bug Fix\+: The C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Dead\+Exception macro was causing the exceptions to be caught by value; this fixes it so they are caught by reference.
\item Bug Fix\+: Exception base class destructor should be public.
\item Bug Fix\+: Minor Text\+Demo fix -\/ gcc does not like temporary objects passed as arguments for non-\/const function parameters.
\item Bug Fix\+: Autotool build fix for Text\+Demo.
\item Bug Fix\+: Small compile fix for VS
\item Bug Fix\+: Groupbox fix (disabled \textquotesingle{}rist\+On\+Click\textquotesingle{})
\item Bug Fix\+: Window\+::is\+Top\+Of\+Z\+Order had an incorrectly constructed loop control. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=172}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=172}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Pixel\+Aligned macro was incorrect when working with negative values. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=167}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=167}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Listbox and Multicolumn\+List were not re-\/sorting the list in resonse to calling handle\+Updated\+Item\+Data which resulted in an incorrectly ordered list if items had changed in a manner that invalidated the current order (in the simplest case, just by changing an items text). (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=162}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=162}})
\item Bug Fix\+: The \textquotesingle{}selected item\textquotesingle{} as returned by Combobox would revert to 0 after interaction with the user that did not end with a positive list selection -\/ this is incorrect; any previous selection should be preserved if the user backs out of making a new selection in the list. NB\+: A side effect of this fix is a change in the order that some events are fired. Previously the droplist show/hide event came first (before any selection events), now the show/hide events come after any selection events. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=164}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=164}}).
\item Bug Fix\+: Slider thumb was not showing up when used within a Tab\+Control. Actual bug was related to thumb getting initialised with bad data caused by unchecked divide by zero in the Falagard window renderer. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=145}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=145}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Invalidating only cached clipped areas for a window was not having the desired effect on child content. Fix addresses \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=165}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=165}}
\item Bug Fix\+: Any window responding to a left mouse button down event would always report the event as \textquotesingle{}unhandled\textquotesingle{} even though it may have taken action based on the event (thus, handling it). Event is now marked as \textquotesingle{}handled\textquotesingle{} if, but only if, the window has to take action such as activating the window or making a change in the z-\/order. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=136}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=136}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Multi\+Line\+Editbox\+::on\+Character should only say it handled the event if it really did. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=155}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=155}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Widgets with a push-\/button-\/esque behaviour were not behaving correctly as regards to being obscured by a window with mouse pass through enabled.(\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=154}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=154}} and \href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2971}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/php\+B\+B2/viewtopic.\+php?t=2971}})
\item Bug Fix\+: We were incorrectly using the clock() function as a timer. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=153}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=153}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Certain assign, append, and insert operations in C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+String would illegally operate beyond the length of the object being assigned, appended or inserted. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=152}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=152}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Bug where Multi\+Column\+List\+Properties\+::\+Multi\+Column\+List\+Properties\+::set was using String\+::substr incorrectly and accessing chars beyond the end of the string. This fix is actually a total rewrite that makes the function a lot more robust, and removes a couple of other issues too. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=171}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=171}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Correctly check for dl and pthread libs. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=143}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=143}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Lua was not correctly detected on (K)Ubuntu type systems (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=138}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=138}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Support lua 5.\+1 in C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Lua.\+cpp (not sure of generator status with 5.\+1) (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=161}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=161}})
\item Bug Fix\+: C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Xerces\+Parser was not compiling with 2.\+8 version of xerces-\/c++. (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=163}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=163}}).
\item Bug Fix\+: Taharez\+Look.\+looknfeel did not conform to the required schema (\href{http://www.cegui.org.uk/mantis/view.php?id=163}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+cegui.\+org.\+uk/mantis/view.\+php?id=163}})
\item Bug Fix\+: Ogre and Irrlicht sample base apps still had C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+\_\+\+S\+A\+M\+P\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+A\+T\+A\+P\+A\+TH defines
\item Bug Fix\+: Demo8 restored to working state.

\item Bug Fix\+: Updated irrlicht support to 1.\+4 (and beyond?)
\item Bug Fix\+: Updated Tree\+Demo to build and run on linux
\item Bug Fix\+: Change Tab\+Pane into Tab\+Content\+Pane. Thanks to Liberator for pointing this inconsistency out.
\item Bug Fix\+: Autotools build was missing the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Group\+Box files.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resorting of lists and trees happened High to Low. This should be the reverse i think.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolved ticket 160\+: Missing \#pragma warning(pop) in elements/\+C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Spinner.\+h

{\bfseries{Release 0.\+5.\+0 (Final)}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Taharez\+Look was missing Item\+Listbox and Listbox\+Item windows \& skin definitions.
\item Added\+: Partial C\+E\+G\+UI support for MingW. It is now possible to build C\+E\+G\+UI under mingw with support for Open\+GL renderer. This approach is going to be generalized later to the other renderer and wiki page explaining the process will follows.
\item Added\+: Missing functions in Window\+Factory\+Manager Lua bindings. Incomplete Falagard\+Window\+Mapping binding as well.
\item Added\+: Lua binding for Out\+Stream\+: File\+Stream (minimal std\+::ofstream).
\item Added\+: X\+ML writing function in Lua bindings.
\item Added\+: --enable-\/debug in configure script instead of using C\+P\+P\+F\+L\+A\+GS=-\/D\+D\+E\+B\+UG ./configure ...
\item Added\+: premake files for Minesweeper sample and minor fixes to make it run in windows.
\item Added\+: the minesweeper demo
\item Added\+: missing doxyfile in order to be in make dist
\item Added\+: Scrollable\+Pane sample
\item Removed\+: Empty Font \textquotesingle{}impl\+Data\textquotesingle{} header files we no longer use.
\item Removed\+: Falagard skinning manual is now a part of the C\+E\+G\+UI manuals sub-\/project, so is no longer included here as a pdf.
\item Modified\+: Changed Demo7 to use the layout X\+ML file instead of hard-\/coded window creation.
\item Modified\+: Demo7\+Window.\+layout now uses the new Item\+Listbox, with items defined within the layout, as the Listbox as opposed to the old style list with hard-\/coded items.
\item Modified\+: Win32\+C\+E\+Gui\+Renderer\+Selector\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is now possible to navigate to the Combobox via keyboard.
\item First available renderer is pre-\/selected into the dialog.
\item With a single renderer available, it is auto-\/selected and dialog is not shown.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Modified\+: Changed compile order under autotools so C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Base is made before things that use it -\/ related to forthcoming cross-\/compile support.
\item Modified Added some missing bits and a whole load of other stuff to \textquotesingle{}make dist\textquotesingle{} to ease a more unified approach to creating packages for the various platforms.
\item Modified\+: Renamed tolua++bin/remake\+\_\+pkg..bat to remove extra period
\item Modified\+: Changed Russian text in Font\+Demo sample -\/ the old text apparently potentially offensive. Thanks to \textquotesingle{}Sanya\textquotesingle{} for the updated text.
\item Modified\+: The Ref\+Counted template now has the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+E\+X\+P\+O\+RT macro as it avoids warnings in client code when using M\+S\+VC.
\item Modified\+: Promote Expat to be the second prefered parser under linux in order to act the same under linux and Win32. Note that the prefered parser is still Xerces. The parser order is now the following \+: Xerces, Expat, Libxml, Tiny\+X\+ML.
\item Modified\+: Widget\+Component had a nasty misspelling of \textquotesingle{}Alignemnt\textquotesingle{}.
\item Modified\+: M\+S\+VC no longer uses C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Config.\+h and C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Samples\+Config.\+h for anything
\item Modified\+: Premake scripts are now much more flexible.
\item Coding Standards\+: Removed various occurrences of the N\+U\+LL macro.
\item Docs\+: Added note to docs for Spinner regarding the lame state of floating point support.
\item Bug Fix\+: List\+Header settings for sizing, moving, and clicking were not properly set on newly created segments.
\item Bug Fix\+: Resolved issue where the algorithm that ensured font textures were filled would actually end up trying to render every glyph within a font.
\item Bug Fix\+: Item\+List\+Base\+::insert\+Item was not setting the Item\+Entry\+::d\+\_\+owner\+List member correctly.
\item Bug Fix\+: Added another \textquotesingle{}special case\textquotesingle{} to Spinner\+::get\+Value\+From\+Text to support typing an initial decimal point.
\item Bug Fix\+: Sometimes compound widgets did not get their components layed out properly when adding the widget to it\textquotesingle{}s parent.
\item Bug Fix\+: The way in which properties would set a window to use the Default\+Font was incorrect; it explicitly set it to the name of the current default, as opposed to a \textquotesingle{}floating default\textquotesingle{}.
\item Bug Fix\+: Font\+Dim did not work correctly since re-\/calculation of the layout was not triggered in response to the font being changed. Added this code to Window\+::on\+Font\+Changed -\/ although more elegant / selective solutions might be considered later on.
\item Bug Fix\+: Added code so that all windows using default font get notified of a change in the default via the normal channel (Window\+::on\+Font\+Changed).
\item Bug Fix\+: There was an issue regarding auto-\/repeat of mouse button down events not getting their state reset if the mouse button was released outside of the window getting the auto-\/repeat events.
\item Bug Fix\+: C\+E\+Gui\+Sample.\+cpp did not get all required includes with certain renderer combinations.
\item Bug Fix\+: Range emplyed by Free\+Type\+Font\+::rasterize was exclusive of the start element; first glyph of every page loaded was missed!
\item Bug Fix\+: C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Window did not properly clean-\/up a custom tooltip if it created one.
\item Bug Fix\+: Calculation of number of glyph pages in Font\+::set\+Max\+Codepoint was incorrect.
\item Bug Fix\+: When the Open\+GL renderer was disabled by ./configure, the S\+I\+L\+LY codec was still being built.
\item Bug Fix\+: When the Open\+GL renderer was disabled by ./configure, the requirement for a default Image\+Codec was still enforced.
\item Bug Fix\+: case of included file in Win32\+C\+E\+Gui\+Renderer\+Selector.\+cpp changed ready to support cross-\/compiling in post 0.\+5.\+0 versions.
\item Bug Fix\+: Support was broken in the Samples framework for newer versions of Ogre.
\item Bug Fix\+: The cegui\+\_\+reldim and cegui\+\_\+absdim macros were missing the C\+E\+G\+UI namespace qualifier.
\item Bug Fix\+: When a glyph failed to load in Free\+Type\+Font, although we logged the error we did not work around the issue of the missing glyph image, so a seg fault was generated upon attempted use of those missing images. This addresses the issue by creating dummy images for missing font glyphs which use a zero size. Mantis \#0000125.
\item Bug Fix\+: Ref\+Counted would call Add\+Ref when the wrapped pointer and its counter were null.
\item Bug Fix\+: Event\+::\+Scoped\+Connection would call members of Bound\+Slot using a potentially null Ref\+Counted pointer.
\item Bug Fix\+: In C++ a namespace does not have a semicolon after the closing brace.
\item Bug Fix\+: Nasty memory leak in Dev\+IL image codec. thanx to mafm on I\+RC.
\item Bug Fix\+: fixed a small error in the comment of C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+\_\+\+D\+E\+C\+L\+A\+R\+E\+\_\+\+W\+I\+N\+D\+O\+W\+\_\+\+F\+A\+C\+T\+O\+RY
\item Bug Fix\+: Tab control did not require to hear about multi-\/clicks on the Tab\+Control scroll buttons. Patch from zap. Mantis \#0000117.
\item Bug Fix\+: Issue with utf8 missing conversion in Tiny\+X\+ML and lib\+X\+ML
\item Bug Fix\+: Added missing public visibility specifier to Scoped\+Connection class members.
\item Bug Fix\+: premake files were not enabling Xerces correctly in the samples.

\item Various internal code cleanups\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removal of unrequired utf8$\ast$ casts on string literals.
\item Removed use of N\+U\+LL macro from the library code.
\item Code refactorings to Font class. Removes some instances of repeated code, and makes some methods shorter / cleaner.
\item Split large methods in Scheme into smaller, more managable, chunks.
\item Removed all the System constructor overloads and replaced with a single method.
\item Removed string literals for component widget names which were scattered throughout the widget code.
\item Replaced virtually all member fields holding pointers to component widgets with getter methods (which basically allows those widgets to be replaced without the parent knowing or caring).
\item Refactoring of X\+ML handler to remove huge if/else if/else construct.
\item Refectored large if / else if / else constructs in all non-\/falagard X\+ML handlers to use a member function for each element type (rather than having all code in one huge function).
\item Event system has been rewritten from scratch.
\item Font system has been rewritten.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added \char`\"{}\+Pushed\+Off\char`\"{} rendering state for button based widgets and Menu\+Item.
\item Added\+: Ability to rename windows.
\item Added\+: C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Samples\+Config.\+h file to allow configuration of samples framework independently of the main config (saves recompiling everything just to change some sample setting).
\item Added\+: F\+PS readout to Open\+GL base app in the samples framework.
\item Added\+: \char`\"{}\+Property\+Link\+Definition\char`\"{} element for Falagard system.
\item Added\+: \char`\"{}control\+Propery\char`\"{} attribute to Section\+Specififations under falagard to enable renering of section imagery to be controled via a named boolean property.
\item Added\+: mouse pass through feature in Window, to ignore mouse events. Nice for making a Default\+Window transparent to the mouse regarding picking windows behind it.
\item Added\+: M\+S\+V\+C++ auto-\/linking for Ogre base app in samples framework.
\item Added\+: grab/restore\+Textures in the Open\+GL renderer to cache texture image data, and later restore it.

\item Added\+: When subscribing to events from \char`\"{}inside\char`\"{} Lua a self object can be registered as well to be passed along with the Event\+Args.
\item Added\+: New Window\+Renderer system, replacing previous system where the Window sub-\/class controlled the rendering process.
\item Added\+: Major update of the Lua\+Script\+Module to support anonymous functions.
\item Added\+: Exception handling has been added for some functions.

\item Added\+: Auto\+Window tag to xml layouts to fetch a window created by the look\textquotesingle{}n\textquotesingle{}feel or the base widget itself.
\item Added\+: Window\+::is\+Auto\+Window member that returns true if the window has \char`\"{}\+\_\+\+\_\+auto\+\_\+\char`\"{} in its name. (a flag is set in the constructor). It\textquotesingle{}s faster than checking the actual string.
\item Added\+: A setting to Window to specify that it should never write X\+ML no matter what if activated. Tooltips get this set by default by System.
\item Added\+: A property ban list to provide a system for mapping which properties should (not) be written to X\+ML. In the respective add\+Properties member functions checks have been added and some properties are banned if we are an auto window.
\item Added\+: Default resource group support to Xerces for use when loading schema files.
\item Added\+: Default resource group support to Scripting\+Module, and implemented it\textquotesingle{}s use in the C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Lua module.

\item Added\+: X\+ML Serialization class for all X\+ML writing.
\item Added\+: Recursive versions of Window\+::get\+Child and is\+Child by ID. They are called get\+Child\+Recursive and is\+Child\+Recursive. Reason for the explicit naming is that it\textquotesingle{}s a pretty expensive operation and should not be used unless necessary.
\item Added\+: Lots of missing members in the Lua bindings.
\item Added\+: setlocale(L\+C\+\_\+\+N\+U\+M\+E\+R\+IC, \char`\"{}\+C\char`\"{}); to the System constructor as we depend on this behaviour.
\item Added\+: set\+Visible member to C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+::\+Mouse\+Cursor.
\item Added\+: bat files to make it easier for Windows users to regenerate the Lua bindings and tolua++cegui.
\item Added\+: Image\+Codec support to the Open\+GL renderer. This allows users to easily write a custom image loader. T\+GA, S\+I\+L\+LY, Dev\+IL, Corona and Free\+Image codecs are supplied.
\item Added\+: const version of get\+Data\+Ptr in Raw\+Data\+Container.
\item Added\+: premake scripts to generate M\+S\+VC solutions.

\item Modified\+: Changed Event\+Set to operate without needing events to be pre-\/added, much like Glabal\+Event\+Set always did.
\item Modified\+: Removal of mass pre-\/specification of events for all classes using events.
\item Modified\+: Cflags to add include dir for C\+E\+G\+UI in C\+E\+G\+U\+I.\+pc.\+in (allows use of $<$C\+E\+G\+U\+I/...$>$ form of include statement).
\item Modified\+: The \char`\"{}\+Lua and tolua++\char`\"{} module has been made a D\+LL on Windows machines.
\item Modified\+: Renamed System\+::set\+Tooltip to System\+::set\+Default\+Tooltip (Mantis \#1Cool.
\item Modified\+: In the lua module, updated Window with casting helpers as member functions. eg. w\+:to\+Frame\+Window()
\item Modified\+: Removed the Static,Static\+Text and Static\+Image from C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Base and implemented them in Falagard\+Base instead.
\item Modified\+: Updated to tolua++ 1.\+0.\+92
\item Modified\+: Moved Lua\+Functor into its own files
\item Modified\+: Reimplemented the \char`\"{}late binding\char`\"{} effect from the v04 Lua module. In v04 the function is always looked up by name. In C\+VS H\+E\+AD the actual Lua function is referenced, but now this will only occur the first time the event is triggered. This means that it\textquotesingle{}s no longer necessary to have a function defined to subscribe it to an event. As long as the function has been created before the event occurs everything will be good Smile
\item Modified\+: Moved subscribe\+Scripted\+Event into Script\+Module to allow more customized script subscription functionality.
\item Modified\+: Made the layout X\+ML handler use subscribe\+Scripted\+Event for Event tags instead of subscribe\+Event with Script\+Functor
\item Modified\+: Removal of \char`\"{}tolua\+\_\+outside\char`\"{} stuff that was no longer needed.
\item Modified\+: Moved the declaration/definition of base window factories into its own files.

\item Modified\+: Moved all rendering member functions out of base classes an into Falagard rendering classes.
\item Modified\+: Removal of virtually all rendering and layout related Window properties from C\+E\+G\+U\+I\+Base -\/ a few are moved to Falagard\+Base, the rest must be implemented via X\+ML.
\item Modified\+: Removal of Taharez\+Look and Windows\+Look modules from the system.
\item Modified\+: Removal of Metrics\+Mode system, and all non-\/unified interface and properties from Window (and related fixes to other classes).
\item Modified\+: Elimination of Renderable\+Element and derived classes.
\item Modified\+: Moved to a C preprocessor macro system for widget module creation.
\item Modified\+: Removal of abstract create\+X\+XX methods from widget base classes -\/ the looknfeel system now auto-\/creates these widgets when specified within the X\+ML.
\item Modified\+: Updated to Tiny\+X\+ML 2.\+4.\+3 in order to allow C\+D\+A\+TA section in X\+ML text node (verbatim text)
\item Modified\+: G\+U\+I\+Layout handler in order to support long value in properties.
\item Modified\+: Made the X\+ML writing system aware of falagard when determining property default values.
\item Modified\+: Switched Property\+Helper to use std\+::ostringstream as the output is much nicer. Changed property default values to the new format where needed.
\item Modified\+: Better error reporting for dynamic module load failures.
\item Modified\+: Switched to using external pcre library. Removed embedded copy of pcre.
\item Modified\+: Switched system to use dynamic libs for X\+ML parsers with programatically configurable default.
\item Modified\+: Factory\+Module to use Dynamic\+Module.
\item Modified\+: Resolved issue with unneeded member qualification (Patch \#1454773).
\item Modified\+: Made String\+::ptr a public member.
\item Modified\+: The bundled tolua++cegui binding generator will now generate a lua\+\_\+\+C\+E\+G\+U\+I.\+cpp that compiles out-\/of-\/the-\/box on Windows
\item Modified\+: Removed the Data\+Container template class, and made it into just Raw\+Data\+Container, non templated.
\item Modified\+: Optimized Falagard\+Multi\+Line\+Editbox to only cache visible lines when rendering.
\item Modified\+: Optimized Button\+Base and Menu\+Item update\+Internal\+State. Mantis \#44
\item Modified\+: Moved the renderers to their own folder named Renderer\+Modules.
\item Modified\+: Optimized picking and rendering by caching screen space rectangles.
\item Modified\+: Applied zap\textquotesingle{}s rewrite of the Font system. Patch \#1508321
\item Modified\+: Texture\+::load\+From\+Memory now takes a Texture\+::\+Pixel\+Format parameter. R\+GB and R\+G\+BA are currently required. Fixes Patch \#1455523 as well. 3rd party renderer modules needs to be updated.
\item Bug fix\+: Open\+G\+L\+Renderer was producing errors and not cleaning up state changes properly (thanx muhkuh25)
\item Bug fix\+: Open\+G\+L\+Renderer was broken when compiled for x86-\/64.
\item Bug Fix\+: Listbox\+Item\+::get\+Owner\+Window should be const

\item Bug Fix\+: Detect \char`\"{}window-\/$>$add\+Child\+Window(window);\char`\"{} and do nothing instead of actually trying.
\item Bug Fix\+: Added missing perform\+Child\+Window\+Layout to Scrollbar\+::on\+Scroll\+Config\+Changed to allow making a look\textquotesingle{}n\textquotesingle{}feel with a thumb that sizes to indicate document size.
\item Bug fix\+: const correctness for Window\+::get\+Look\+N\+Feel
\item Bug fix\+: Frame\+Window, is\+Titlebar\+Enabled and is\+Close\+Button\+Enabled were return the opposite of what they should.
\item Bug Fix\+: Frame\+Window should do relayout if text changes to allow using a fontdim in the titlebar dimensions.

\item Bug Fix\+: Fixed case in Static\+Text where default text area was always used if frame was disabled.
\item Bug Fix\+: Image offsets were\textquotesingle{}nt being properly handled for the corners in Frame\+Component.
