 \hypertarget{licensing_licensing_sec_4}{}\section{Licensing 101\+: What it all means!}\label{licensing_licensing_sec_4}
While C\+E\+G\+UI itself is licensed under the M\+IT license, it is important that users understand that you\textquotesingle{}re probably not only using the C\+E\+G\+UI code, but also that of certain other libraries that C\+E\+G\+UI is built on top of -\/ this means that you may have to additionally comply with the licensing of those other libraries and components as well.

First I want to state that I\textquotesingle{}m not a \textquotesingle{}license lawyer\textquotesingle{}; what follows is my personal interpretaion of the licensing situation. If you\textquotesingle{}re in any doubt at all, you should either directly contact the authors / license owners of the specific components you have concerns about, or -\/ if you have cash to burn -\/ consult a legal professional.

The exact way that you determine which of the external licenses you need to give consideration to will largely depend upon the choices you make as regards to the various options you have when building C\+E\+G\+UI.

At the very minimum you will need to consider C\+E\+G\+UI\textquotesingle{}s M\+IT license and the B\+SD license of the string encoders library (unless you do not compile the Spinner widget code, in which case it\textquotesingle{}s just C\+E\+G\+UI\textquotesingle{}s M\+IT license).

The next two libraries that are nearly always used are P\+C\+RE and Free\+Type2. With M\+S\+V\+C++ builds using our provided dependency packages these libraries are always linked in statically; while on the Mac using Xcode our provided dependency packages use dynamic linking, although those component frameworks will generally be distributed as part of your application. This means that on both of these systems you must comply with the license conditions for P\+C\+RE and Free\+Type2 (again, this only applies if you have not explicitly disabled the use of these libraries).

If you enabled bi-\/directional text support using the integrated copy of the minibidi code, then you need to consider the M\+IT license used for that code.

Beyond these items, the other libraries that you will consider will depend upon your choices for renderering library, image codec library, X\+ML parser and scripting module. Basically this means if you\textquotesingle{}re not using -\/ and therefore not distributing -\/ a particular module you do not need to worry about the licensing any of the dependency libraries that module may use.

Generally the option modules use only the underlying library suggested in the name of the module; for example, the Xerces\+Parser module only uses the Xerces-\/\+C++ library and the Free\+Image\+Image\+Codec uses Free\+Image. The only two potential \char`\"{}gotchas\char`\"{} exist with the Lua based scripting module that can use an embedded copy of the tolua++ code, and the Open\+GL renderer module that can contain a copy of the Open\+GL extension wrangler library (G\+L\+EW). \hypertarget{datafile_licensing}{}\section{C\+E\+G\+UI Data File and Media Licensing}\label{datafile_licensing}

\hypertarget{datafile_licensing_data_lic_overview}{}\subsection{Overview}\label{datafile_licensing_data_lic_overview}
Various data and media files are present in the C\+E\+G\+UI distribution. Largely these files are intended as examples for demonstration purposes only, as such the files beneath the datafiles directory may not be covered by the blanket M\+IT license that covers the library code itself.

This said, it is believed that {\itshape all} files beneath the datafiles directory are at least freely distributable for {\itshape non commercial purposes}, and are included with C\+E\+G\+UI -\/ as example material -\/ in good faith. Any disputes as regards to the legal status of any of the sample data files included within the C\+E\+G\+UI distribution should be directed to \href{mailto:team@cegui.org.uk}{\texttt{ team@cegui.\+org.\+uk}}.

 \hypertarget{datafile_licensing_data_lic_XML}{}\subsection{The X\+M\+L and .\+X\+S\+D files}\label{datafile_licensing_data_lic_XML}
All of the X\+ML files and the .xsd X\+ML schema files were specifically created for C\+E\+G\+UI either by myself or other C\+E\+G\+UI team members and are released under the same M\+IT license as the library code.

 \hypertarget{datafile_licensing_data_lic_scripts}{}\subsection{The Lua script files}\label{datafile_licensing_data_lic_scripts}
Any script code files in the lua\+\_\+scripts directory were created for the C\+E\+G\+UI project and are released under the same license as the C\+E\+G\+UI library.
